# English-Spanish Translation Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model capable of translating English text into Spanish. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model development and incorporates Streamlit for web application integration.

## Usage

- **Model Script:** The main model is located in `app/model.py`.
- **Model and App Utilities:** Various helpers for both the model and the app can be found in `app/model_utils.py`.
- **Streamlit Integration:** The Streamlit app is defined in `app/app.py`.
- **Text Vectorization:** The script `vectorization.py` is utilized for text vectorization (tokenization).
- **Trained Model:** The trained model is saved as `eng_esp_model.keras`.
- **Model Testing:** The notebook `eng_spanish_translation.ipynb` is used for testing the model.
