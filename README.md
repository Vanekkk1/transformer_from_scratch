English-Spanish Translation Model
This project is about building a machine-learning model for translating English text to Spanish using TensorFlow and Keras, with the Streamlit app.

Usage
The model is located in app/model.py
different helpers for the model and the app itself in app/model_utils.py
Streamlit integration in app/app.py

The vectorization.py script is used for text vectorization(tokenization)

The trained model os saved at eng_esp_model.keras

The eng_spanish_translation.ipynb notebook is used for testing the model.
